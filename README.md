## Identifying Biomarkers for Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning
This research explores the use of machine learning (ML) models to identify the most important biomarkers for diagnosing cancer. The data used in this research is an extremely high-dimensional dataset that represents various cancer biomarkers.

### Data
The dataset used in this research contains a large number of samples and features. It includes measurements of gene expressions and protein concentrations of various cancer biomarkers. The data was obtained from a publicly available database.

### Methodology
This study employed various classes of ML models, including linear, non-linear models and ensembles, to identify the most important biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The performance of these models was compared using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (macro & micro)

Feature selection techniques were applied across filters and wrappers types, including a novel filtering approach. The purpose of feature selection was to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the accuracy of the models. The results of the different methods are discussed in the paper.

### Results
The results of this study show that certain ML models, such as Logistic Regression and support vector machines, perform better in identifying the most important biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The results also show that the novel filtering approach outperformed the traditional feature selection methods in certain cases.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of using ML models to identify important biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The results of this study can be used to develop more accurate diagnostic tools for cancer. The paper highlights the importance of feature selection and the effectiveness of the novel filtering approach used in this research.

### Notebooks
The Jupyter notebook in this repository demonstrates the process of identifying important biomarkers for cancer diagnosis using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training and evaluation. The notebook also shows how to use the `scikit-learn` library to implement the different models used in this study.
