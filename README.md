# Identifying Biomarkers for Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning
This research explores the use of machine learning (ML) models to identify the most important biomarkers for diagnosing cancer. The data used in this research is an extremely high-dimensional dataset that represents various cancer biomarkers.

## Data
The dataset used in this research contains a large number of samples and features. It includes measurements of gene expressions and protein concentrations of various cancer biomarkers. The data was obtained from a publicly available database.

## Methodology
This study employed various classes of ML models, including linear, non-linear models and ensembles, to identify the most important biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The performance of these models was compared using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (macro & micro)

Feature selection techniques were applied across filters and wrappers types, including a novel feature selection approach. The purpose of feature selection was to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the accuracy of the models. The results of the different methods are discussed in the paper.
